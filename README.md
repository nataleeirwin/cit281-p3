# Project 3

This project helped gain experience interpreting functional descriptions and specifications to complete an assignment, breaking a project into manageable components, and writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode.

This also involved creating and using code modules, refactoring using modern JavaScript syntax, and using Fastify with the GET verb, routes, and query parameters.

Source code files can be found on GitHub at [this](https://github.com/nataleeirwin/cit281-p3) link.
