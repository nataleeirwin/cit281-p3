# Project 3

This project helped gain experience interpreting functional descriptions and specifications to complete an assignment, breaking a project into manageable components, and writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode.

This also involved creating and using code modules, refactoring using modern JavaScript syntax, and using Fastify with the GET verb, routes, and query parameters.


### Elements

- Create project files
- Initialize as git repo
- Create and test code module functions
- Create index.html file
- Initialize project folder as a Node.js folder, and install Fastify
- Update web server code to import Fastify and fs packages, and coinCount function
- Add / route with GET verb, and web server listen
